# JTWPA_Numerical_Simulations
Here you can find scripts describing different types of JTWPAs using WRSPICE, PSCAN2 and JosephsonCircuit Simulators. 
Files: pscanarc.py, circuit_twpa.cir, circuit_twpa.hdl, snail.hdl and snail_reversed.hdl refer to PSCAN2 (http://pscan2sim.org/ here you can find all documentations).
File JosephsonCircuit.jl is taken from (https://github.com/kpobrien/JosephsonCircuits.jl) and adapted for reversed Kerr TWPA with 250 unit SNAILs.
