to set the desired external flux for each unit cell, 
we need to modify the SNAIL TWPA WRSPICE equivalent circuit, and model 
the flux bias by introducing a small linear inductance, L_add=0.1 pH, 
in each SNAIL element, and adding an auxiliary external inducting 
loop with mutual inductance M (Fig. 6). In this way, the flux is 
coupled via the external inductor Lext and is controlled by an external 
source of dc current Idc, which is included in the model. Here we set Lext = 1.6 μH and the mutual inductance is proportional to √(L_add L_ext ) [19].
The case of 0 external flux corresponds to setting Idc = 0.0 μA, while 0.5 external flux corresponds to setting Idc = -2.5 μA
