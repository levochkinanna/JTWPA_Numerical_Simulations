# These codes allow to simulate 250 cells Reversed Kerr TWPA with WRSPICE package.
# All information related to the features and syntax of the tool is on the official website
# http://wrcad.com/manual/wrsmanual/wrsmanual.html
# For JTWPA flux bias we introduce a small linear inductance in each SNAIL element 
# and add an auxiliary external inducting loop with mutual inductance M (see .png file)
# In this way, the flux is coupled via the external inductor L_ext and is controlled by an external 
# source of dc current Idc
